# SerialTransfer
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PowerBroker2%2FSerialTransfer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PowerBroker2%2FSerialTransfer)  [![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/SerialTransfer.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/SerialTransfer)<br /><br />
SerialTransfer is an easy to use Arduino library for transferring packetized data fast and reliably via **Serial, I2C, and SPI interfaces**. Interconnect your Arduinos today minus the headace with SerialTransfer!

[A mirror library is also available for Python!](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/pySerialTransfer)

This library:
- can be downloaded via the Arduino IDE's Libraries Manager (search "SerialTransfer.h")
- works with "software-serial", "software-I2C", and "software-SPI" libraries
- is non blocking
- uses packet delimiters
- uses consistent overhead byte stuffing
- uses CRC-8 (Polynomial 0x9B with lookup table)
- allows the use of dynamically sized packets (packets can have payload lengths anywhere from 1 to 254 bytes)
- supports user-specified callback functions
- **can transfer bytes, ints, floats, structs, even large files like JPEGs and CSVs!!**

# Packet Anatomy:
```

# ***How To Use:***

See the [example sketches](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SerialTransfer/tree/master/examples)

- datum = tx/rx a single object
- data = tx/rx multiple objects

# ***NOTE:***

SPITransfer.h and it's associated features are not supported for the ESP8266, Arduino Nano 33 BLE or DUE.

Should the automatic detection of SPI support fail you can define the macro `SPI_TRANSFER` to `1` to forcefully enable SPI or to `0` to forcefully disable it.
