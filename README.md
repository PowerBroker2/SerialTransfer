SerialTransfer is an easy to use Arduino library for transferring packetized data fast and reliably via **Serial, I2C, and SPI interfaces**. Interconnect your Arduinos today minus the headache with SerialTransfer!

[A mirror library is also available for Python!](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/pySerialTransfer)

This library:
- can be downloaded via the Arduino IDE's Libraries Manager (search "SerialTransfer.h")
- works with "software-serial", "software-I2C", and "software-SPI" libraries
- is non blocking
- uses packet delimiters
- uses consistent overhead byte stuffing
- uses CRC-8 (Polynomial 0x9B with lookup table)
- allows the use of dynamically sized packets (packets can have payload lengths anywhere from 1 to 254 bytes)
- supports user-specified callback functions
- **can transfer bytes, ints, floats, structs, even large files like JPEGs and CSVs!!**

# Packet Anatomy:

# ***How To Use:***

See the [example sketches](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SerialTransfer/tree/master/examples)

- datum = tx/rx a single object
- data = tx/rx multiple objects

# ***NOTE:***

SPITransfer.h and it's associated features are not supported for the Arduino Nano 33 BLE or DUE and other boards. This header file is disabled by default, but can be enabled by commenting out `#define DISABLE_SPI_SERIALTRANSFER 1` within `SerialTransfer.h`.
